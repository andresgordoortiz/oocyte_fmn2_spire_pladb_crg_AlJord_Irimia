*betAS* is a user-friendly R package that allows intuitive analysis and
visualisation of differential alternative splicing (AS) based on beta
distributions.

Beta distributions are suitable to quantify inclusion proportions of
alternative sequences, using RNA sequencing reads supporting their
inclusion and exclusion as surrogates for the two distribution shape
parameters. Each such beta distribution has the inclusion proportion as
mean value and is narrower when the read coverage is higher,
facilitating the interpretability of its precision when plotted. *betAS*
uses beta distributions to accurately model PSI values and their
precision, to quantitatively and visually compare AS between groups of
samples.

*betAS* allows the analysis of user-provided tables with AS
quantifications, such as those obtained by
[vast-tools](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools),
[rMATS](https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats-turbo) or
[Whippet](https://github.com/timbitz/Whippet.jl), ranking differentially
spliced events by a significance metric that incorporates the compromise
between the uncertainty in individual sample estimates and the
variability among replicates.

# Installing and starting the program

Install *betAS* by typing the following in an R console:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("DiseaseTranscriptomicsLab/betAS@dev")
```

After the installation, load betAS and other required packages by
typing:

```{r load, message=FALSE, warning=F}
library(betAS)
```

Consider also loading the following libraries, for visualization
purposes, by typing:

```{r cran, include=F}
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.r-project.org"))
```


```{r load2, message=FALSE, warning=F}

if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

if(!require(plotly)) install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)

if(!require(dplyr)) install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

if(!require(cowplot)) install.packages("cowplot")  
library(cowplot)
```

# Loading alternative splicing quantification data

## Load user-provided files

To load data for differential alternative splicing analyses, we can use
the `getDataset` function. *betAS* accepts files sourced from
`vast-tools`, `rMATS`, or `whippet`. These files should contain junction
reads information (*e.g.* results obtained from the vast-tools' `tidy`
module are not supported).

Based on the value assigned to the `tool` parameter, the `pathTables`
parameter can take the following input types:

-   `tool="vast-tools"`: Should be a path pointing to a
    `*INCLUSION_LEVELS_FULL*.tab` file.
-   `tool="rMATS"`: Should be a path pointing to a `*MATS.JC.txt` file.
-   `tool="whippet"`: Should be a list of paths (minimum of 2) pointing
    to `*.psi.gz` files.

```{r load_data_user, eval=FALSE}

# Example to load data from vast-tools
dataset <- getDataset(pathTables=file.choose(), tool="vast-tools")



```

The `getDataset` function retrieves the inclusion tables specific to the
chosen tool for further analyses. However, we also need to use the
`getEvents` function in order to format inclusion tables into a standard
format that is compatible with *betAS* workflow.

The output from `getEvents` is an object with 4 attributes:

-   `PSI`: A data frame with information regarding the splicing events
    and their inclusion levels.
-   `Qual`: A data frame detailing the events and information related to
    the coverage associated with each event. This representation follows
    the vast-tools representation of inclusion (inc) and exclusion (exc)
    reads.
-   `EventsPerType`: A named table summarising the number of events per
    type.
-   `Samples`: Vector containing the names of the samples considered.

```{r load_default, eval=F}
tool <- "vast-tools" # example tool, can be one of the following: "vast-tools", "rMATS", "whippet"
dataset <- getEvents(dataset, tool = tool)

```

For simplicity, in this tutorial we will be using a default dataset from
**vast-tools** to illustrate such features. At this stage, the user can
explore the raw / non-filtered data by browsing in the four objects
inside `dataset`. It might be useful to check at this stage the overall
results for a given gene / event of interest.

```{r explore_event_gene}
gene <- "Actn4"
head(dataset$PSI[dataset$PSI$GENE==gene,])

event_of_interest <- "MmuEX0003638"
dataset$PSI[dataset$PSI$EVENT==event_of_interest,]
```

# Filtering datasets

*betAS* allows to filter the dataset based on alternative splicing event
types, PSI value range to consider and minimum number of supporting
reads.

## Filter dataset based on alternative splicing event types and minimum number of supporting reads

*betAS* allows to filter event types. The supported event types are in
accordance to the ones documented in the alternative splicing
quantification tools supported by betAS:

-   For vast-tools, valid `types` include Alt3, Alt5, ANN, C1, C2, C3,
    IR-C, IR-S, MIC and S as described in [vast-tools
    documentation](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools).
-   For Whippet, valid `types` include CE, AA, AD, IR, TS, TE, AF, AL
    and BS as described in [whippet
    documentation](https://github.com/timbitz/Whippet.jl).
-   For rMATS, as each output file from this tool considers only one
    event, the `types` parameter should be set to `NULL`

To explore the type of events in a dataset and their respective number,
we can access the `EventsPerType` field in the `dataset`variable.

```{r event_types}
dataset$EventsPerType
```

*betAS* also allows to filter events with less than a given number of
junction reads (sum of inclusion and exclusion reads) in at least one
sample. To do so, the user can specify the minimum number of reads to
consider in the `N`parameter.

In this tutorial, we will be considering only exon skipping events (C1,
C2, C3, S & MIC events from `vast-tools`) with at least 10 junction read
counts in all samples.

```{r filter_event_types_nb_reads}
dataset_filtered <- filterEvents(dataset, types=c("C1", "C2", "C3", "S", "MIC"), N=10)

cat(paste0("Alternative events: ", nrow(dataset_filtered$PSI)))

```

## Filter dataset based on PSI value range

*betAS* allows to filter events based on their PSI value range (in
percentage, *i.e.* PSI ∈ [0,100]). We will be keeping only alternative
events, i.e. \~ 0 \< PSI \< 100 in **all samples**. If you wish to keep
all of the events and don't filter by PSI range, skip this step or put
`minPsi`=0 and `maxPsi`=100.

```{r filter_PSIrange}

dataset_filtered <- alternativeEvents(dataset_filtered, minPsi=1, maxPsi=99)

cat(paste0("Alternative events: ", nrow(dataset_filtered$PSI)))

```

## Plotting PSI distribution across samples

After filtering the data to only keep events of interest, we can have an
overview of the PSIs on the samples being analysed.

```{r bigPicturePlot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

bigPicturePlot <- bigPicturePlot(table = dataset_filtered$PSI)
bigPicturePlot + theme_minimal()

```

# Group definition and management from automatically detected or user-defined sample list

To allow for alternative splicing analyses between groups of interest,
the user must firstly specify to what groups the samples under analyses
belong to.

To check the names of the samples being used, we can access the
`Samples` attribute inside the `dataset` object.

```{r sample_names}
dataset_filtered$Samples

```

In order to ease group visualization, we can assign a color to each
group. In this section we showcase how to assign a group to a given
color, based on a manually defined palette. To automatically define
color palettes of N colors the user might want to check [Custom color
palette for group definition](#groupdefpalette) section of this
tutorial.

## Group definition based on user-defined list

We can also define groups of samples based on a given column of the
metadata. We will be using betAS metadata for vast-tools built-in
example to ease group creation:

```{r load_metadata_example}
metadata <- read.csv(file.choose(), sep = "\t")
# Extract only the odd rows
metadata <- metadata[seq(1, nrow(metadata), by = 2),]
```

For this example we will use the cell type as a grouping variable,
*i.e.* Neurons or Embrionic Stem Cell (ESC). This information can be
accessed through the `CellType` column in the example metadata. The name
of the samples to be used can be retrieved by accessing the `Run` column
in the example metadata.

If using user-provided data, the user must also provide a metadata
table, or ensure that the final result corresponds to `groupList`
presented in this section.

```{r aux_featuregrouo}
# Define variable of the metadata table to be used as a grouping variable
groupingVariable <- "Description"
groups <- unique(metadata[, groupingVariable])
metadata$fastq_files<-gsub(".fastq.gz", "", metadata$fastq_files)
# Define vector of sample names based on the example metadata 
samples <- metadata$fastq_files

# Define colors for the two groups
random_colors <- c("#FF9AA2", "#FFB7B2", "#FFDAC1")
```

```{r featuregroup}

groupList <- list()

for(i in 1:length(groups)){

  groupNames <- samples[which(metadata[,groupingVariable] == groups[i])]

  # Assign new group
  currentNames <- names(groupList)
  groupList[[length(groupList)+1]] <- list(name = groups[i],
                                           samples = groupNames,
                                           color = random_colors[i])
  names(groupList) <- make.unique(c(currentNames, groups[i]))

}

groupList

```

```{r festuregroup_visualize, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
# Visualize colors being used
slices <- rep(1, length(groups))  # Equal-sized slices for each color
# Display the pie chart with colors
pie(slices, col = random_colors[1:length(groups)], border = "black", labels=groups, main = "Color palette for group definition")
```

# Differential alternative splicing between two groups

betAS approach for alternative splicing analyses takes into account two
metrics for each alternative splicing event under analyses: the
magnitude of the effect (𝚫PSI = PSI~betAS~(group A) - PSI~betAS~(group
B)) and the statistical significance of such changes. For the latter,
betAS introduces three approaches: probability of differential splicing
(**Pdiff)**, **F-statistic** or false positive rate (**FPR**).

-   **Pdiff**: This approach takes the two sets of random points per
    condition and calculates, for each AS event's estimated ∆PSI, the
    proportion of differences between these that are greater than zero,
    which has the same interpretation as asking what proportion of beta
    distribution-emitted values for one condition are higher than those
    emitted for the other, thus reflecting the probability of
    differential AS of PSI~betAS~(group A) being greater than
    PSI~betAS~(group B).

-   **F-statistic**: *betAS* also enables an ANOVA-like analysis of
    variance, comparing inter- and intra-group variabilities. For each
    event, ***within*** is considered the set of differences between
    each pair of samples that are part of the same group and
    ***between*** the set of differences between each pair of groups.
    The ratio of the median absolute values of ***between*** and
    ***within*** therefore provides an "F-like" statistic. This metric
    provides a compromise between the effect size of AS differences and
    their significance.

-   **FPR**: Random generation of points from a beta distribution is
    used to estimate the null distribution's PSI and its precision.
    Then, one point is randomly selected from each of the sample's null
    distribution and, keeping the samples' group assignment (*i.e.*,
    which samples belong to each group), the ∆PSI between groups under
    the null hypothesis is calculated. The process is repeated many
    times (10 000 by default) and the FPR is the proportion of ∆PSI
    random simulations that are larger than (*i.e.*, more extreme) or
    equal to the empirical ∆PSI.

## Calculate statistical metrics for differential alternative splicing & visualize results

Firstly, we need to define the groups we will be analysing. This step is
particularly important when we have more than one group defined, but
want to compare only two of them.

```{r groups_auxiliary}
# Define groups
groupA    <- "ControlFmn2+-"
groupB    <- "Fmn2+-_+10mMPlatB"
# Define samples inside each group
samplesA    <- groupList[[groupA]]$samples
samplesB    <- groupList[[groupB]]$samples
dataset_filtered$Samples<-gsub("X", "", dataset_filtered$Samples)
dataset_filtered$Samples<-gsub("_merged_trimmed", "", dataset_filtered$Samples)
names(dataset_filtered$PSI) <- gsub("X", "", names(dataset_filtered$PSI))
names(dataset_filtered$PSI) <- gsub("_merged_trimmed", "", names(dataset_filtered$PSI))

# Convert samples into indexes
colsGroupA    <- convertCols(dataset_filtered$PSI, samplesA)
colsGroupB    <- convertCols(dataset_filtered$PSI, samplesB)
```


betAS utilizes R's `rbeta` and `sample` functions, introducing inherent uncertainty. 
Running betAS twice may yield different results, particularly near significance thresholds. 
Variability in outcomes can be informative, signaling cases where an event's significance is on the cusp. 
However, to ensure reproducibility, users can set a seed, avoiding randomization of the emitted points. 
By default, the seed is set to TRUE, and will be used as such for the tutorial's reproducibility.

Moreover, the user can choose to weight the number of points emitted for beta distributions based on the coverage of each sample.
With large sample sizes, uncertainty and significance of differential splicing are mostly determined by biological variability among 
replicate samples. However, as stated in betAS manuscript, working with small sample sizes implies a good compromise between modelling 
the uncertainty in the estimation of inclusion levels of alternative splicing events in individual samples and accounting for that 
biological variability among replicates. As such, we consider that for not-so-small sample sizes and/or a knowledgeable user intending 
to tune the aforementioned compromise differently, size factors proportional to coverage can be useful. This parameter should be used 
with care, and by default it is set to FALSE.

### Probability of differential splicing (Pdiff)

To calculate the **Pdiff** for all events in our dataset, we will use
the `prepareTableVolcano` function. To visualize the results in a
volcano plot, we will use the `plotvolcanoPdiff` function.


```{r plotvolcano_Pdiff, fig.width=14, fig.height=10, warning=F}
options(error=recover)
volcanoTable_Pdiff <- prepareTableVolcano(psitable = dataset_filtered$PSI,
                                    qualtable = dataset_filtered$Qual,
                                    npoints = 500,
                                    colsA = colsGroupA,
                                    colsB = colsGroupB,
                                    labA = groupA,
                                    labB = groupB,
                                    basalColor = "#89C0AE",
                                    interestColor = "#E69A9C",
                                    maxDevTable = maxDevSimulationN100, 
                                    seed=TRUE, 
                                    CoverageWeight = FALSE)

volcano_Pdiff <- plotVolcano(betasTable = volcanoTable_Pdiff,
                            labA = groupA,
                            labB = groupB,
                            basalColor = "#89C0AE",
                            interestColor = "#E69A9C") 

volcano_Pdiff
 
```

The above plot colors in pink and labels by default the events with a
∆PSI\>0.1. However, if these are in high number, the labels might not
appear. To make the plot interactive, we can use the `ggplotly`
function.

```{r plotvolcano_Pdiff_interactive, warning=F}
# change size points manually
volcano_Pdiff$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size <- 2
volcano_Pdiff$layers[[2]]$aes_params$size <- 1

# Plot interactively
plotly_volcano_Pdiff <- ggplotly(volcano_Pdiff, width = 700, height = 500) %>%
                          layout(
                            font = list(size = 10),
                            xaxis = list(
                              title = list(font = list(size = 14)),  # Adjust as necessary
                              tickfont = list(size = 10)  # Adjust the tick font size here
                            ),
                            yaxis = list(
                              title = list(font = list(size = 14)),  # Adjust as necessary
                              tickfont = list(size = 10)  # Adjust the tick font size here
                            )
                          )

 
hover_text  <- paste(
  "Event: ", volcanoTable_Pdiff$EVENT,
  "<br>Pdiff: ", round(volcanoTable_Pdiff$Pdiff,3),
  "<br>Deltapsi: ", round(volcanoTable_Pdiff$deltapsi,3),
  sep = ""
)

 

plotly_volcano_Pdiff$x$data[[1]]$text <- hover_text # all points
plotly_volcano_Pdiff$x$data[[2]]$text <- NULL 
  
plotly_volcano_Pdiff


```

The results can also be manually inspected by browsing the
`volcanoTable_Pdiff` table

```{r Pdiff_table}
head(volcanoTable_Pdiff[,c("GENE","EVENT","COORD","Pdiff","deltapsi")])
```

### F-statistic

To calculate the **F-statistic** for all events in our dataset, we will
use the `prepareTableVolcanoFstat` function. To visualize the results in
a volcano plot, we will use the `plotVolcanoFstat` function. The user
can also use the approach presented above to make the plot interactive.

```{r plotvolcano_Fstat, fig.width=14, fig.height=10, warning=F}
volcanoTable_Fstat <- prepareTableVolcanoFstat(psitable = dataset_filtered$PSI,
                                    qualtable = dataset_filtered$Qual,
                                    npoints = 500,
                                    colsA = colsGroupA,
                                    colsB = colsGroupB,
                                    labA = groupA,
                                    labB = groupB,
                                    basalColor = "#89C0AE",
                                    interestColor = "#E69A9C",
                                    maxDevTable = maxDevSimulationN100, 
                                    seed=TRUE,
                                   CoverageWeight=F )

volcano_Fstat <- plotVolcanoFstat(betasTable = volcanoTable_Fstat,
                            labA = groupA,
                            labB = groupB,
                            basalColor = "#89C0AE",
                            interestColor = "#E69A9C") 

volcano_Fstat
 
```

```{r Fstat_table}
head(volcanoTable_Fstat[,c("GENE","EVENT","COORD","Fstat","deltapsi")])
```

### False positive rate (FPR)

To calculate the **FPR** for all events in our dataset, we will use the
`prepareTableVolcanoFDR` function. To visualize the results in a volcano
plot, we will use the `plotVolcanoFDR` function. The user can also use
the approach presented above to make the plot interactive.

```{r plotvolcano_FDR, fig.width=14, fig.height=10, warning=F}
volcanoTable_FDR <- prepareTableVolcanoFDR(psitable = dataset_filtered$PSI,
                                    qualtable = dataset_filtered$Qual,
                                    npoints = 500,
                                    colsA = colsGroupA,
                                    colsB = colsGroupB,
                                    labA = groupA,
                                    labB = groupB,
                                    basalColor = "#89C0AE",
                                    interestColor = "#E69A9C",
                                    maxDevTable = maxDevSimulationN100,
                                    nsim = 100, 
                                    seed=TRUE, 
                                    CoverageWeight = FALSE) 
        
volcano_FDR <- plotVolcanoFDR(betasTable = volcanoTable_FDR,
                            labA = groupA,
                            labB = groupB,
                            basalColor = "#89C0AE",
                            interestColor = "#E69A9C") 

volcano_FDR
```

```{r FDR_table}
head(volcanoTable_FDR[,c("GENE","EVENT","COORD","FDR","deltapsi")])
```

## Visualize individual events

To illustrate betAS approach for an individual event with differential
alternative splicing between Neurons and ESC, we will be using the event
[`MmuEX0003638`](https://vastdb.crg.eu/event/MmuEX0003638@mm10). 

```{r eventID}
eventID <- "MmuEX0015119"
```

We can visualize the beta distributions for this event for each sample.

```{r densities_per_event, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, warning=F}
# Auxiliary data to add increment based on the event coverage to avoid dividing by zero 
data("maxDevSimulationN100")

# Differential alternative splicing between multiple groups

The differential AS approach implemented by *betAS* can be applied to
multiple (*i.e.*, more than two) groups in a novel ANOVA-inspired way
that extends the Pdiff definition to the comparison of the differences
between samples belonging to different biological conditions to those
found between replicates.

## Dataset loading and filtering

To illustrate this, we applied multiple-group *betAS* to the analysis of
AS differences in a subset of human transcriptomes of forebrain,
hindbrain, heart, kidney, liver and testis. This dataset is a subset of
the [Human RNA-seq time-series of the development of seven major
organs](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6814/)
public human dataset.

```{r load_default_data_multgroups}
dataset_multgroups <- dataset

# load metadata
metadata_multgroups <- metadata
metadata_multgroups
```

For this dataset, we are considering a reasonable number of samples
(46). As such, in cases like this, it might be interesting to be less
conservative on the filtering step and choose to keep all events
irrespectively of their PSI value. However, for the purpose of this
tutorial, we will keep the criteria of filtering discussed above, for
computational ease of this exercise. For simplicity, we will consider
only exon-skipping events.

```{r filter_multgroups}

cat(paste0("Initial number of events: ", nrow(dataset_multgroups$PSI)))


dataset_multgroups_filtered <- filterEvents(dataset_multgroups, types=c("C1", "C2", "C3", "S", "MIC"), N=10)
cat(paste0("Alternative events (after event type and coverage filtering): ", nrow(dataset_multgroups_filtered$PSI)))


dataset_multgroups_filtered <- alternativeEvents(dataset_multgroups_filtered, minPsi=1, maxPsi=99)
cat(paste0("Alternative events (after PSI range filtering): ", nrow(dataset_multgroups_filtered$PSI)))


```



```{r featuregroup_mult}

groupList <- list()

for(i in 1:length(groups)){

  groupNames <- samples[which(metadata_multgroups[,groupingVariable] == groups[i])]

  # Assign new group
  currentNames <- names(groupList)
  groupList[[length(groupList)+1]] <- list(name = groups[i],
                                           samples = groupNames,
                                           color = random_colors[i])
  names(groupList) <- make.unique(c(currentNames, groups[i]))

}

groupList

```

# Visualize colors being used
slices <- rep(1, length(groups))  # Equal-sized slices for each color
# Display the pie chart with colors

# Supplementary Information

## Custom color palette for group definition {#groupdefpalette}

In the provided examples, the color palette used for group definition
was manually defined. If the user wishes to automatically generate a
palette of `N`colors, the following code is advisable:

```{r custom_palette, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
#install.packages("grDevices")
library(grDevices)

generate_pastel_colors <- function(N) {
  pastel_colors <- vector("list", length = N)
  
  for (i in 1:N) {
    # Generate random values for hue, chroma, and luminance
    hue <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 360)  # Adjust the range for a different initial hue
    chroma <- runif(1, min = 50, max = 80)  # Adjust these values for your desired pastel range
    luminance <- runif(1, min = 80, max = 90)  # Adjust these values for your desired pastel range
    
    # Create a pastel color using hcl() with the random values
    pastel_color <- hcl(hue, chroma, luminance)
    
    pastel_colors[[i]] <- pastel_color
  }
  
  return(pastel_colors)
}


# Generate 10 random pastel colors
N <- 10
random_pastel_colors <- generate_pastel_colors(N)

cat("HEX codes of generated pastel colors: ")
cat(unlist(random_pastel_colors))

# Prepare data for the pie chart
slices <- rep(1, N)  # Equal-sized slices for each color
# Display the pie chart with pastel colors
pie(slices, col = unlist(random_pastel_colors), border = "black", labels=unlist(random_pastel_colors), main = "Automatically generated color palette for group definition")

```
