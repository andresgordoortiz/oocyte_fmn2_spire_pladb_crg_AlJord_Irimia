**Project Type**: Master Thesis

## Project Overview

This repository consists on the data exploration, processing and plotting for the Oocyte Alternative Splicing Analysis after microtubule-related shaking inhibition for the ***Al Jord Lab @CRG*** during my master thesis. Specifically, differential analysis, simulation and Ontology exploration of mRNA splicing events were performed on three different experiments of mouse oocytes; splicing-modulator *Pladienolide B* treatment at two different doses (1mM and 10mM), *double knock-out of FMN2 F-actin nucleating factor*, and *double knock-out of the FMN2-interacting Spire protein*.

## Samples

## Repository Structure

- **config/**: Configuration files for Nextflow, Docker, and HPC cluster settings.
- **data/**: Raw and processed data files. Raw data is excluded from version control.
- **notebooks/**: Exploratory and analysis notebooks for VSCode and RStudio.
- **scripts/**: Custom scripts for data processing and analysis.
- **workflows/**: Nextflow pipeline scripts for workflow management and reproducibility.
- **results/**: Output data, tables, and figures (only summaries and essential plots stored here).
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including installation instructions and workflow details.
- **tests/**: Scripts for testing data integrity and workflow components.
- **.github/**: GitHub-specific workflows for continuous integration and issue templates.

## Processing Workflow

1. PladB and FMN2-/- technical replicates were first merged using *cat*.
2. All sample *fastq.gz* files were quality checked using fastQC and MultiQC [[1]](#1)
3. Reads were then **mapped** to the latest [mm10 build](https://vastdb.crg.eu/libs/vastdb.mm2.23.06.20.tar.gz) of the mouse genome using the Bowtie2 implementation of **Vast Tools**, which also allows for curated identifiction and quantification of splicing events. See [Vast-tools](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools) for indications on how to manually download the builds.
4. Inclusion Tables from each study were then transferred to RStudio for downstream processing. Simulations through the **Beta distribution** and statistical significance (*p-value <= 0.05*) for each splicing event were calculated using the [betAS](https://github.com/DiseaseTranscriptomicsLab/betAS/) package.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andresgordoortiz/24CRG_ADEL_MANU_OOCYTE_SPLICING.git
   cd 24CRG_ADEL_MANU_OOCYTE_SPLICING

**Important**: Some workflows require the conda environment from *config/env.yml* to be created and exist. make sure it is installed in the home directory (~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh).
